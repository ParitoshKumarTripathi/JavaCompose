# JavaCompose
Was curious if could make JetpackCompose like lib in Java, without using Material 3 components.

- I would be happy 😃 if someone would like to contribute to it.
- Currently there is not much code, just basic impl.
- But still works 👍

## File Structure
- Color, Theme, Typography (For Material You)
- Row, Column, Button, Text (For Material 3)

### I will add documentation within couple of days, still for reference and knowing the syntax please view the source code of the sample Contacts app.
